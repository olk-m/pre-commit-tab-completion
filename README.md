# pre-commit-tab-completion
Shell tab completion scripts for pre-commit.

## How to use

Select a required file (zsh, bash, tcsh) and copy its content somewhere your shell looks for completions.  
For example, for zsh (ohmyzsh) I use `/usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_pre-commit`.

Restart a shell.

You can find more examples in the [shtab documentation](https://docs.iterative.ai/shtab/use/#cli-usage).
